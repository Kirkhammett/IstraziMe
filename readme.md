# Istrazi.Me

[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/laravel/framework/license.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/laravel/framework)

Istrazi.Me is a Laravel based web app which displays a list archaeological locations based in Macedonia, as well as details, ticket costs and photographs
for each individual location.

## Usage
The .env.example file contains information about setting up your own development environment, once you set up that file, rename it to .env as that file will be ignored by git and your server/database details will remain secure and won't be uploaded to github.

The vendor folder is also ignored by default. It does contain all project dependencies, but they can be installed by running "composer install", so no need for clogging up the repo with extra files.
## Official Documentation

Documentation for the framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
